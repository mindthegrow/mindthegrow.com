      <description>Problem Determining how many people to hire in order to trim your product can be very difficult.
Approach You give us the ranges of yields you expect to experience and how quickly you believe your employees can process the product. We can also factor in the fact that delays occur and sometimes can prevent other jobs from being performed. You tell us what you are willing to pay and how long the shifts you plan on scheduling have to be.</description>

      <description>Problem Business owners are too busy managing day-to-day operations to devote any significant amount of time to researching. Decisions about the potential size of markets for new products are difficult to make without an understanding of the influence of estimation. Uncertainties at each step of the research process can compound and lead to conclusions about the potential revenue to be wildly inaccurate.
Approach We identify the quantities of interest relevant to your specific problem and then hone in on what data to collect.</description>

      <description>Problem Testing equipment has some natural variation built in to it that scientists are used to handling. However, classical statistical methods fail to address the natural variability present in different batches of product.
Approach The approach we take is rooted in cutting-edge computational mathematics to maximize the utility of information and address the underlying uncertainty in potency inherent to the cannabis plants.
We can use the latest developments from simulation-based optimal experimental design to adapt your testing regiments to budgetary and temporal constraints.</description>

      <description>Problem The Social Consumption License created by [Initiative 300][1] in Denver, CO is so new that very little information exists online. A client approached us to perform a preliminary investigation into what is required to get started.
Approach We compiled a report that categorized the main obstacles and linked to resources for accomplishing the requirements. The focus was on clarity of exposition and brevity.
Outcome The client decided the location requirements were prohibitively expensive and chose not to pursue the project further.</description>

      <description>Problem A client approached us with interest in exploring the feasibility of opening up a new Cannabis Consumption Enterprise in Denver, CO (our home-base!).
The passing of Initiative 300 to legalize designated areas for the consumption of cannabis products was exciting, but the legal hoops to jump through are numerous, so it is no surprise that there is a severe paucity of operational businesses. At the time of this writing (mid-2018), only two are operational.</description>
