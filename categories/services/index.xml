      <description>Problem Testing equipment has some natural variation built in to it that scientists are used to handling. However, classical statistical methods fail to address the natural variability present in different batches of product.
Approach The approach we take is rooted in cutting-edge computational mathematics to maximize the utility of information and address the underlying uncertainty in potency inherent to the cannabis plants.
We can use the latest developments from simulation-based optimal experimental design to adapt your testing regiments to budgetary and temporal constraints.</description>

      <description>Problem The Social Consumption License created by [Initiative 300][1] in Denver, CO is so new that very little information exists online. A client approached us to perform a preliminary investigation into what is required to get started.
Approach We compiled a report that categorized the main obstacles and linked to resources for accomplishing the requirements. The focus was on clarity of exposition and brevity.
Outcome The client decided the location requirements were prohibitively expensive and chose not to pursue the project further.</description>
