      <description>Coffee Today Coffee is the third most popular beverage in the world, following water and tea. It is especially prevalent in American culture, with an estimated 450 million cups consumed daily (in the United States alone). It is primarily consumed for its stimulating properties, but it is also a cultural habit in all walks of life.
In recent years, coffee culture has blown to astronomical proportions. Coffee is no longer just a drink for the break room, but it is an entire experience.</description>

      <description>Yerba Mate Yerba Mate (or Hierba Mate) is a caffeinated tea native to South America that has been used for centuries as a stimulant and health supplement. It was originally used by the indigenous Guaraní people of South America, but its use became common practice since the colonization of the Americas.
In the past years, Mate has become a popular beverage around the world. Although it’s traditionally consumed with a filter-straw (bombilla) from a small cup called a gourd, the “mainstreamization” of the tea has created an immense market.</description>
