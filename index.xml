      <description>Avocados Today Avocados are trending. Sales have grown tremendously over the past decade due to factors such as cuisine trends (avocado toast) and diet crazes (Paleo and KETO diets). But it is not merely fads that drive sales. The Avocado is a vital staple of the North American diet. Thousands of fast-casual restaurants and Tuesday night taco dinners rely on the creamy fruit to supply flavor and nutrients. The forecast clearly demonstrates that sales will only grow higher.</description>

      <description>Coffee Today Coffee is the third most popular beverage in the world, following water and tea. It is especially prevalent in American culture, with an estimated 450 million cups consumed daily (in the United States alone). It is primarily consumed for its stimulating properties, but it is also a cultural habit in all walks of life.
In recent years, coffee culture has blown to astronomical proportions. Coffee is no longer just a drink for the break room, but it is an entire experience.</description>

      <description>Yerba Mate Yerba Mate (or Hierba Mate) is a caffeinated tea native to South America that has been used for centuries as a stimulant and health supplement. It was originally used by the indigenous Guaraní people of South America, but its use became common practice since the colonization of the Americas.
In the past years, Mate has become a popular beverage around the world. Although it’s traditionally consumed with a filter-straw (bombilla) from a small cup called a gourd, the “mainstreamization” of the tea has created an immense market.</description>

      <description>Precision Testing equipment has some natural variation built in to it that scientists are used to handling. However, classical statistical methods fail to address the natural variability present in different batches of product.
The approach we take is rooted in cutting-edge computational mathematics to maximize the utility of information and address the underlying uncertainty in potency inherent to the cannabis plants.
Efficiency We can use the latest developments from simulation-based optimal experimental design to adapt your testing regiments to budgetary and temporal constraints.</description>

      <description>Responsible Agriculture Less water. Less fertilizer. Less waste. Fewer pesticides. We are all collective stewards of our environment. These goals may seem at odds with profit margins, but through creative solutions and robust analytics, we help you achieve responsible growth for your plants and your business.
Sustainability It is a principle baked in to everything we do. It cannot just be a buzzword.
Sustainability practices are vital for maintaining steady product yields and a healthy environment.</description>

      <description>Proposition A client approached us with interest in exploring the feasibility of opening up a new Cannabis Consumption Enterprise in Denver, CO (our home-base!).
The passing of Initiative 300 to legalize designated areas for the consumption of cannabis products was exciting, but the legal hoops to jump through are numerous, so it is no surprise that there is a severe paucity of operational businesses. At the time of this writing (mid-2018), only two are operational.</description>
