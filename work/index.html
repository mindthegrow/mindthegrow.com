<p>CASE STUDY</p>

<p>Proposition
A client approached us with interest in exploring the feasibility of opening up a new Cannabis Consumption Enterprise in Denver, CO (our home-base!).</p>

<p>The passing of Initiative 300 to legalize designated areas for the consumption of cannabis products was exciting, but the legal hoops to jump through are numerous, so it is no surprise that there is a severe paucity of operational businesses. At the time of this writing (mid-2018), only two are operational.</p>

<p>Our client felt they could do much better. We at Mind the Grow (MtG) can help them execute.</p>

<p>Summary
The client wanted a comprehensive overview of the process and a cost-of-entry analysis in order to assess whether or not to proceed with such an investment. Since there would be a long period of applying, they would need to sustain themselves and the lease for an undetermined amount of time.</p>

<p>We determined the range of costs that would be faced in order to allow the client to know how much external investment would be required should they choose to open the business.</p>

<p>As part of our research and presentation to the client, we categorized the hurdles to overcome into logical groupings. Then we decided, why not just share this with the world? We want to see more enterprises and competition in the mix.</p>

<p>Result
The consultants at MtG help un-muddy the waters by providing a cohesive summary of the requirements, restrictions, and procedures that surround opening a new Cannabis Consumption Enterprise. Check out the digital write-up we created as a supplement at the link below!</p>

<p>The Social Consumption License
created by Initiative 300 is so new that very little information exists online.
We felt that needed to change, so we distilled our research for your convenience.</p>

<p>Location
The first and most important step is to select a valid location for the Cannabis Consumption Establishment (CCE). Keep in mind the following restrictions.
REQUIREMENTS
01. No residential zones.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Must be at least 1000ft from schools, child care locations, city-owned recreational centers, or drug/alcohol treatment facilities.</p></li>

<li><p>CCEs must be established in an area which will give community support to the existence and operation of the enterprise (see below).</p></li>

<li><p>Proof of possession of the premises where the CCE is located with a valid zone-use permit and most recent certificate of occupancy.</p></li>

<li><p>You cannot sell, provide, transfer or distribute cannabis for renumeration. Not inside, not outside. Just no. You must not allow outdoor smoking at street level in a location visible from a public right-of-way or where children congregate.</p></li>

<li><p>Operating hours are prohibited from occurring during the the hours of 2am to 7am.</p></li>

<li><p>No person may be in possession of more than one ounce of cannabis. No liquor, either. You may not hold a liquor license and designated consumption area license on the same premises.</p></li>

<li><p>No &ldquo;conspicuous advertising.&rdquo; You must seek community support for locations where you want to advertise your business.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>CHALLENGES
01. You must have a location before applying. You may have to sit on your facility for an uncertain amount of time as the application gets processed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You must find a location that meets all the requirements in the code and is also located in close proximity to an existing recreational dispensary where your customers may legally procure products for consumption on your premises.</p></li>

<li><p>For ease of business, nearby dispensaries should be willing and able to partner with your enterprise in the form of deals, sponsorships, workshops, etc. to entice customers. Scoping out potential partnerships is a time-consuming process that must be included in the real estate search.</p></li>

<li><p>Even after securing a location and partnerships, the application may be denied or delayed pending further action, so you must have existing capital to endure the process.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Community
You must have proof of community support for the business as provided by an eligible neighborhood organization.
REQUIREMENTS
01. For any suitable location, take note of all registered neighborhood organizations (RNO) in the district.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should receive written approval/endorsement from at least one such eligible organization.</p></li>

<li><p>Craft formal plan to create positive impacts in the neighborhood where the licensed premises are located.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The full outline of what constitutes licensing requirements can be found in Sec. 6-210 of the DRMC.</p>

<p>CHALLENGES
01. Find the organizations with which you will engage to craft a plan for community engagement. Start with an official list of RNOs in Denver. The Community Engagement Plan from the Dept. of Excise and Licenses is a useful document for your search.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your organization must have written plans to promote and encourage full participation in the regulated marijuana industry in order to positively impact the community.</p></li>

<li><p>Have written policies and procedures to address any concerns or complaints expressed by residents and businesses within the neighborhood surrounding the licensed premises.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Design
Many of these specifications are not unique to Cannabis Consumption Enterprises and are concerned primarily with establishing a safe and sanitary location.
REQUIREMENTS
01. A health and sanitation plan for sanitization and cleaning of cannabis consumption accessories to be rented or otherwise made available for use. Information on Health Inspections can be found on Denver&rsquo;s government website.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A marijuana waste plan that includes a detailed description of how employees will dispose of any Waste that is left, abandoned, or otherwise not consumed on the premises.</p></li>

<li><p>An odor control and abatement plan in the same form and substance as would be required in DRMC Sec 4-10, and any rules promulgated thereto, if the applicant intends to allow smoking or vaping of marijuana within the Designated Consumption Area (DCA).</p></li>

<li><p>A red-lined floor plan of the DCA showing its location within the business. See below for details.</p></li>

<li><p>A description and supporting evidence that details how the DCA complies with the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A Public Health and Sanitation Basic Questionnaire available through the Dept. of Public Health &amp; Environment is an appropriate place to start.</p>

<p>DETAILS
01. Draw a floor plan to-scale on an 8.5x11 piece of paper, one page per floor. It must show the layout of the establishment and the principal uses of each section of the floor area.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The location of the DCA within the establishment must be contiguous and outlined in red.</p></li>

<li><p>Include dimensions, security cameras, and establishment boundaries, including external and internal walls, doors, fences, gates and the like.</p></li>

<li><p>Indicate where all signage will be located. These should cover responsible usage, access restrictions, and any standardized placards. As with all buildings, exit and emergency signage should also be shown.</p></li>

<li><p>You must specify where you will be locating your posting notice for the public hearing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Administration
The dry details. You will need to have the following ready in order to fill out your application.
REQUIREMENTS
01. Description of proposed hours of operation. You should review the Lawful Presence Affidavit for more information.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A &ldquo;Responsible Operations Plan,&rdquo; which details how &ldquo;employees will monitor and prevent over-intoxication, underage access to the DCA, driving under the influence of marijuana, the illegal distribution of marijuana or marijuna products within DCA, and any other potential criminal activity on the premises.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>A documented employee training program that addresses all components of the Responsible Operations Plan.</p></li>

<li><p>Dates for any planned events that would be conducted as part of the establishment as an extension of normal operations.</p></li>

<li><p>For any &ldquo;Person&rdquo; owning 5% or more of the entity or receiving 5% or more of profits (as well as any trade names or assumed names), you must submit:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Name, address, email, and date of birth.
National criminal history records check conducted by the FBI upon submission of fingerprinting records an all required documents.
Suitable evidence of proof of lawful presence.
06. The Basic Application is available on the Denver government website, along with a FAQ, and Advisement Affidavit, which you will need if someone is preparing the documents on your behalf.</p>
